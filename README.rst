pysh is a Shell that mixes Python and Bash syntax.

Discover it
===========

It's really easy to get started. All you need is Python3. Download the zip file, unzip it on the destination of your choice, chmod the `pysh` file and execute it.:

  unzip aspyct-pysh-xxxx.zip -d pysh
  cd pysh
  chmod +x pysh
  ./pysh

You are now in what looks like a regular python interpreter. Try to write some python::

  > print("Hello")
  > if True:
  .    print("pysh looks terrific ! :)")

Shell commands also work::

  > ls
  > vi <yourfile>
